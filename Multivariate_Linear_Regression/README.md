# Multivariate Linear Regression
## General info
This project is about creating multidimensional linear regression class, also nown as multivariate linear regression. What linear regression is ?

>In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression. This term is distinct from multivariate linear regression, where multiple correlated dependent variables are predicted, rather than a single scalar variable.
