# Linear Regression
## General info
This project is about creating simple linear regression class. What linear regression is ?

>In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables). The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression. For more than one explanatory variable, the process is called multiple linear regression. This term is distinct from multivariate linear regression, where multiple correlated dependent variables are predicted, rather than a single scalar variable.

My linear regression is created in Python, in form of a class. It's using batch gradient descent for best fitting the line in given parametres.
