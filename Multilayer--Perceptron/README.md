# Multilayer perceptron
## General info
This project is about creating multilayer perceptron from scratch. What perceptron is ?

>A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a class of feedforward artificial neural network (ANN). The term MLP is used ambiguously, sometimes loosely to any feedforward ANN, sometimes strictly to refer to networks composed of multiple layers of perceptrons.
