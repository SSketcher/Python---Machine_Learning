# Perceptron
## General info
This project is about creating perceptron from scratch. What perceptron is ?

>In machine learning, the perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. A binary classifier is a function which can decide whether or not an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class.

My perceptron is created in Python, in a class form. The perceptron is than tested on a popular Iris Dataset as a binary classifier. The trained model and the dataset is than visualized on a graph where the model corresponds to decision boundary. The decision boundary shows how the model is separate the data between data points we aim for and the rest of datapoints.
